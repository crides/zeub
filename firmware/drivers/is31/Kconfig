        Enable an IS31FL3729 LED Matrix driver.
        The IS31FL3729 is a general purpose 16x8 or 15x9 LED Matrix
        programmed via an I2C compatible interface. Each LED can be dimmed
        individually with 8-bit PWM data and 8-bit scaling data which
        allows 256 steps of linear PWM dimming and 256 steps of DC current
        adjustable level.
